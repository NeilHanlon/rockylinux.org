In response, original founder of CentOS, Gregory Kurtzer, announced <link>via a comment on the CentOS website</link> that he would again start a project to achieve the original goals of CentOS. It's name was chosen as a tribute to early CentOS co-founder Rocky McGaugh. By December 12, the code repository of Rocky Linux had become the top-trending repository on GitHub.",

The second release candidate, of version 8.4, the last before the stable release, was released on June 4, 2021. On June 21, 2021, the stable release of Rocky Linux 8.4 was released, with the code name \"Green Obsidian\".",
