We are honored to announce that Rocky Linux has been recognized by the [Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) as a Digital Public Good. This recognition reflects our community's commitment to open source principles and service to the common good by providing a sustainable, community-driven Enterprise Linux distribution. It is a testament to the larger goals we hope Rocky Linux will further - inclusive technology access, user empowerment, and digital rights. We are grateful for the trust placed in us by this recognition, and will continue striving to uphold these larger goals that align with the UN Sustainable Development goals.

Since starting in 2020, Rocky Linux has rapidly grown to be among the most used Enterprise Linux distributions. It now helps power critical civil infrastructure, government services, and private industry around the world – areas that align with [Sustainable Development Goal 9: “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization). We are proud to serve these crucial systems, and consider this an honor as well as a responsibility.

The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder initiative endorsed by the United Nations Secretary-General, working to accelerate the attainment of the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals) in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.

The goal of the DPGA and its registry is to promote digital public goods in order to create a more equitable world. Being recognized as a DPG increases the visibility, support for, and prominence of open projects that have the potential to tackle global challenges. To become a digital public good, all projects are required to meet the [DPG Standard](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard) to ensure that projects truly encapsulate open source principles.
